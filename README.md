A simple sorted Binary-Tree.

Can be used to analyse numbers of a .csv-file.

A simple partially ordered binary tree that is composed of child nodes.
The first number that will be inserted is the root node.<br>
number that is smaller than the parent node is appended as a left subnode.<br>
A number that is greater than the parent node is appended as a right subnode.<br>
At the end, for example, the result is sorted like this:<br>

          6
        / \
       3   7
      /\   /\
     1  2    9
